          A man named Dom Cobb wakes up on a shore and is dragged into a house
          belonging to a wealthy Japanese businessman named Mr. Saito. Cobb's
          partner Arthur appears, and together they explain to Saito that new
          dream-sharing technology has rendered thoughts vulnerable to theft,
          advertising their security services to Saito as dream-sharing experts.
          After Saito leaves, Cobb steals documents from a safe upstairs, and is
          apprehended by Saito and a woman named Mal. Cobb shoots and kills
          Arthur, who wakes up in an apartment, where Cobb and Saito are
          revealed still to be asleep and dreaming. As the dream in Saito's
          mansion collapses, all of the men wake up in the apartment. Saito
          reveals that he set up the operation as an audition, and the men wake
          up again in a moving train.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Later, in Kyoto, Saito then asks Cobb whether he can perform
          "inception." Saito tells Cobb that if he can plant an idea in the mind
          of his business rival, Robert Fischer, he can reunite Cobb with his
          children in the United States. Against Arthur's judgment, Cobb
          consents to the plan and travels to Paris to find a dream "architect."
          Cobb's father-in-law Stephen Miles introduces him to Ariadne, a
          graduate student skilled in creating labyrinths.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Cobb introduces Ariadne to the basic rules and terms of dream-sharing
          technology, such as a "totem" (an object that lets a person know they
          are not dreaming) and a "kick" (a physical jolt that brings a dreamer
          out of a dream). Although Cobb's first rule is never to use memories
          to build dreams, the memory of his dead ex-wife Mal violently invades
          his shared dream with Ariadne. Cobb then travels to Mombasa to recruit
          Eames, a British forger, and Yusuf, a Kenyan chemist, to aid with the
          mission. Back in Paris, the team convenes with Saito to discuss the
          plan.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Eames maintains that the incepted idea must be simple, seemingly
          self-generated, and planted over three layers of Robert's dream.
          Ariadne becomes worried when she infiltrates Cobb's dreams one night
          to learn that he still harbors feelings of guilt about his dead wife,
          Mal, whose memory keeps erupting into his dreams. Ariadne warns Cobb
          that he cannot keep Mal imprisoned in his subconscious forever. When
          Robert Fischer's father dies, the team decides to execute their plan
          on a trans-Pacific flight from Sydney to Los Angeles, on which Robert
          Fischer is scheduled to be a passenger.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          On the plane, Cobb discreetly spikes Robert's drink with a sedative,
          and the team enters into a shared dream with Robert. They manage to
          take Robert hostage but are immediately ambushed by a team of
          rifle-wielding assailants. Saito is gravely injured, and Cobb realizes
          too late that experts have helped Robert militarize his subconscious
          against unwanted extraction. To make matters worse, Yusuf's powerful
          sedative may leave whomever is killed in the dream in
          "limbo"—unconstructed dream space. Although shaken, the team decides
          to continue with the plan. Cobb extracts combination lock numbers from
          Robert, who discusses his cold relationship with his father with his
          Uncle Peter.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          In the back of Yusuf's van, the team descends into the dream's second
          layer—a hotel lobby, where Eames poses as a female thief to distract
          Robert. Cobb, himself posing as a security expert, pretends to help
          Robert by alerting him to the robbery and leading him to a hotel room
          upstairs. Cobb manipulates Robert into becoming suspicious of the
          motives of his Uncle Peter, and the three of them sink into a third
          layer of the dream, which takes place in and around a snow-blanketed
          fortress.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          The team scurries to complete the inception mission when they hear
          Yusuf, whose van has crashed off a bridge, give the "kick"—Edith
          Piaf's "Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien." Realizing they have limited time,
          Ariadne tells the rest of the team the quickest way to infiltrate the
          fortress. Arthur scrambles in the dream's second layer to improvise an
          effective "kick" in the hotel where Cobb and the others are asleep,
          which has become a zero-gravity environment given the falling van in
          the dream's first layer. In the third layer, Robert reaches the
          fortress's "strong room" but is shot dead by Mal, who suddenly
          appears. Cobb thinks the operation is over, but Ariadne convinces him
          to go one layer deeper in order to save Robert and redeem the mission.
          Saito dies as Eames places explosive charges around the fortress to
          act as the third layer's "kick."
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Cobb and Ariadne descend into a fourth layer of the dream: a crumbling
          cityscape that Cobb and Mal built together in the fifty years they
          spent in "limbo." Cobb confesses to Ariadne that he "incepted" the
          idea in Mal that limbo was not real, so that she would agree to wake
          up and be with their children; however, Mal continued to believe that
          reality was a dream, and eventually committed suicide, leaving Cobb
          ridden with guilt. In a nearby building, Ariadne and Cobb find Mal and
          Robert, whom Ariadne wakes up so that he can infiltrate the fortress's
          "strong room." Cobb tells Mal that she is not real, and Robert inputs
          a code in the strong room that reveals a large operating room with his
          dying father inside. Robert's father tells him to live his own life,
          rendering the inception complete. As the dreamworld collapses, Cobb
          tells Ariadne to ride the "kicks" up through the layers of the dream
          while he rescues Saito. Cobb washes up on a shore and is dragged into
          Saito's house, just like in the film's opening scene. Saito, now old,
          recognizes Cobb as a man from a half-remembered dream, and the two of
          them suddenly wake up on the passenger airliner next to Ariadne,
          Robert, Eames, and Saito, who have all successfully made it back to
          reality. Cobb arrives in the United States and is greeted by Stephen
          Miles, who takes him to his children. Cobb arrives home and goes
          outside to play with his children, while his totem continues to spin.

          Cobb is trained in dream-sharing technology by Stephen Miles, a
          professor of architecture and Dom's father-in-law. Cobb is also a
          criminal, unable to return to the United States under suspicion of
          killing his wife Mal, who still haunts his subconscious. Cobb agrees

          ambitious operation yet: to perform inception in a three-tiered dream.
          Although Ariadne is initially disturbed by the content of Cobb's
          dreams, she is lured back into the scheme by the limitless and
          awe-inspiring architectural possibilities of dreams. Ariadne also

          Saito, the wealthy businessman who hires Cobb to infiltrate Robert
          Fischer's dreams. Watanabe described his embodiment of Saito as being
          a "cycle" of emotions that reflects the film's circular plot.

              You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your
              state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and
              reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave
              the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is
              spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. It is
              beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite
              characters ever to grace the screen. I don't see it often, in case
              it's not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret, that
              I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a
              perfect world for us all. For some, perhaps it is in the cinema
              watching this.

              That fact this movie has an 8.8 Rating shows people's desire to be
              perceived as being intelligent. This movie is unnecessarily
              complicated for the sake of being complicated. The story telling
              is terrible. If a character in a story has to tell the audience
              directly what the hell is going on the story sucks. A lot of
              Christopher Nolan's stuff is like this. Whenever someone hears
              criticism of Inception the first line of attack is "you just
              didn't understand it". I understood it, just didn't like the way
              it was presented.

              Having said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and
              some of his stuff is good. He is still one of the only director's
              today that uses practical effects. The hallway rotating scene with
              Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing.
              Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a 5/10.

              Well, after writing my summary maybe I don't need to write a
              review. First off, this isn't really my type of film. But I
              watched it and tried to follow it as closely as possible. But the
              film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy. It
              is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry.
              For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly.
              Sure things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.
              And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with
              chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah. I
              frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it
              was over. I don't understand all the fuss over this.

              There is no way "Inception" will be a bad movie because it was
              directed by Christopher Nolan. There are many words to describe
              this movie and those are: mind-bending, imaginative, exciting,
              overwhelming, entertaining, and awesome. "Inception" might be the
              only movie this summer that has an original concept. "Inception"
              is very unique and it is fresh to everybody. The visuals were
              overwhelming. The action scenes are awesome. The CGI effects were
              realistic and eye candy. The story is interesting and
              mind-bending.The performances were great. Leonardo DiCaprio is
              still a great actor. Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the
              best parts of the movie. Cillian Murphy is disappointing though.
              Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is flawless. "Inception" is
              mind-bending and non-stop entertaining. Once again Christopher
              Nolan made another successful blockbuster. "Inception" might be
              the best movie of the year.
