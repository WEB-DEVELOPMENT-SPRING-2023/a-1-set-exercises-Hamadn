              You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your
              state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and
              reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave
              the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is
              spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. It is
              beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite
              characters ever to grace the screen. I don't see it often, in case
              it's not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret, that
              I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a
              perfect world for us all. For some, perhaps it is in the cinema
              watching this.

            <p class="para">
              That fact this movie has an 8.8 Rating shows people's desire to be
              perceived as being intelligent. This movie is unnecessarily
              complicated for the sake of being complicated. The story telling
              is terrible. If a character in a story has to tell the audience
              directly what the hell is going on the story sucks. A lot of
              Christopher Nolan's stuff is like this. Whenever someone hears
              criticism of Inception the first line of attack is "you just
              didn't understand it". I understood it, just didn't like the way
              it was presented.
              <br />
              Having said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and
              some of his stuff is good. He is still one of the only director's
              today that uses practical effects. The hallway rotating scene with
              Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing.
              Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a 5/10.

              Well, after writing my summary maybe I don't need to write a
              review. First off, this isn't really my type of film. But I
              watched it and tried to follow it as closely as possible. But the
              film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy. It
              is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry.
              For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly.
              Sure things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.
              And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with
              chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah. I
              frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it
              was over. I don't understand all the fuss over this.

              There is no way "Inception" will be a bad movie because it was
              directed by Christopher Nolan. There are many words to describe
              this movie and those are: mind-bending, imaginative, exciting,
              overwhelming, entertaining, and awesome. "Inception" might be the
              only movie this summer that has an original concept. "Inception"
              is very unique and it is fresh to everybody. The visuals were
              overwhelming. The action scenes are awesome. The CGI effects were
              realistic and eye candy. The story is interesting and
              mind-bending.The performances were great. Leonardo DiCaprio is
              still a great actor. Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the
              best parts of the movie. Cillian Murphy is disappointing though.
              Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is flawless. "Inception" is
              mind-bending and non-stop entertaining. Once again Christopher
              Nolan made another successful blockbuster. "Inception" might be
              the best movie of the year.
