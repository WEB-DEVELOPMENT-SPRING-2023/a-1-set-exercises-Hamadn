        <p class="para">
          Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the protagonist of Inception. He is a
          professional dream extractor, spy, and thief who uses military-grade
          technology to infiltrate people's dreams and retrieve their secrets.
          Cobb is trained in dream-sharing technology by Stephen Miles, a
          professor of architecture and Dom's father-in-law. Cobb is also a
          criminal, unable to return to the United States under suspicion of
          killing his wife Mal, who still haunts his subconscious. Cobb agrees
          to Saito's inception plan as a way to return to his home country and
          reunite with his children.

        <p class="para">
          Ariadne (Elliot Page) is a promising graduate student in architecture
          whom Stephen Miles recommends to Dom Cobb as a builder of
          dreamscapes—complex, maze-like environments that help ward off
          projections. She helps Dom and his team try to execute their most
          ambitious operation yet: to perform inception in a three-tiered dream.
          Although Ariadne is initially disturbed by the content of Cobb's
          dreams, she is lured back into the scheme by the limitless and
          awe-inspiring architectural possibilities of dreams. Ariadne also
          pushes Cobb to confront Mal and disclose his inner torment to the rest
          of the team.

          Arthur is Cobb's resourceful partner and second-in-command: a
          "producer" of sorts who plans, organizes, and researches all his
          missions. Arthur plays many roles, at times giving Cobb advice,
          providing background information, scouting locations, counseling
          Ariadne, and administering "kicks." Arthur opposes Saito's inception
          plan and advises Cobb to turn it down, but Cobb ignores him. Cobb
          later scolds Arthur when his research fails to turn up the fact that
          Robert Fischer has militarized his subconscious.

          Eames (Tom Hardy) is a British forger whom Dom recruits in Mombasa to

          Eames gives Cobb and the rest of the team crucial advice about how to
          perform inception, telling them that the idea must be exceedingly
          simple, and seem self-generated. As a skilled forger, Eames is easily
          able to take the guise of other people in dreams. Eames is also
          described as a "fence"—someone who buys stolen goods and resells them
          for profit.

        <p class="para">
          Saito is a wealthy Japanese businessman who is the target of Cobb and
          Arthur's first dream infiltration. Saito explains to Cobb that the
          operation is in fact an "audition" for a plan of Saito's own, which
          involves "incepting" an idea in the mind of his business rival, Robert
          Fischer. Saito and Cobb form an uneasy alliance so that Cobb can
          reunite with his children in the United States, in exchange for
          helping Saito secure his empire. At the end of the film, Cobb must
          rescue Saito from "limbo," a scene also glimpsed in the opening
          sequence.

          Yusuf is a Kenyan chemist whom Cobb recruits in Mombasa. Yusuf is able
          to produce a sedative that induces the kind of deep sleep necessary
          for inception. Yusuf shows Cobb a small group of permanent
          dream-sharers in his basement, who prefer the world of dreams over the
          world of reality. Although Yusuf's sedative induces a sound sleep, the
          sleeping person remains sensitive to the "kick" that brings one out of
          a dream. In Saito's plan, Yusuf is tasked with driving a van in the
          "first" layer of Robert Fischer's dream.

          Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) is the billionaire scion of his
          father's powerful energy company, also Saito's primary business rival.
          The failing health of Robert's father Maurice ignites a power struggle
          between Robert and his uncle Peter over who will control the company.
          Although Robert is desperate for his father's approval and committed
          to leading the company forward, Saito wants Cobb and his team to
          "incept" the idea in Robert to instead break up his father's empire.
          They achieve this by convincing Robert that his father wanted him to
          live his own life rather than follow in his footsteps.

          Mal (Marion Cotillard) is Cobb's dead wife who still haunts his
          subconscious. Cobb and Mal had two children together, and acquired an
          interest in dream-sharing under the tutelage of Mal's father Stephen
          Miles. Mal spends fifty years in limbo with Cobb, and grows to prefer
          the world of dreams to the world of reality. In order to return to
          reality and be with their children, Cobb "incepts" the idea in Mal
          that their world is fake and they must wake up. Upon awakening, Mal
          continues to believe she is dreaming, and commits suicide. Cobb's
          lingering guilt over her death causes her projection to violently
          invade his dreams.

          first person to introduce Cobb and Mal to dream-sharing technology.
          Miles acts as a go-between for Cobb and his children, given that Cobb
          cannot return to the United States to be with them under suspicion of
          killing Mal. Miles is begrudging about Cobb's use of dream-sharing
          technology for criminal acts of theft and espionage, but nevertheless
          recommends a skilled graduate student in architecture to join Cobb's
          team. Miles later greets Cobb at the airport after he successfully
          performs inception and is able to return to the United States.

          the mission fails, Cobb and Arthur upbraid Nash for an inconsistency
          in the carpeting in Saito's apartment, which causes Saito to realize
