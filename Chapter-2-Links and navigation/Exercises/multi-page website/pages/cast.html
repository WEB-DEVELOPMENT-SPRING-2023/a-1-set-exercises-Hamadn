        <h2 class="chr">Leonardo DiCaprio</h2>
        <p class="para">
          Leonardo DiCaprio is an American actor who plays Dom Cobb, an
          experienced thief of dreams. DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast
          in Inception, having stated that he had been looking to work with
          Christopher Nolan for some time. However, many other prominent actors
          were considered for the role, including Brad Pitt and Will Smith.
          DiCaprio encouraged Nolan to refine the script so that Cobb's inner
          torment over Mal could give audiences a firm emotional anchor, amid
          the film's complex and heady explorations of dream-sharing technology.

        <h2 class="chr">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</h2>
        <p class="para">
          Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an American actor who plays Arthur, Dom's
          sidekick and partner in crime who is responsible for the planning and
          research portions of his job. During filming, Gordon-Levitt performed
          nearly all of his own stunts. Gordon-Levitt conceived of Arthur as a
          resourceful, pragmatic "producer" character who helps provide the
          knowledge and material capabilities for Cobb's missions. Gordon-Levitt
          went on to collaborate with Christopher Nolan two years later, playing
          John Blake in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).

          outspoken queer activist, and in 2016-2017 co-hosted two seasons of a

          Saito, the wealthy businessman who hires Cobb to infiltrate Robert
          Fischer's dreams. Watanabe described his embodiment of Saito as being
