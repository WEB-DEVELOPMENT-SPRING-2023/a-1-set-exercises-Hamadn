          A man named Dom Cobb wakes up on a shore and is dragged into a house
          belonging to a wealthy Japanese businessman named Mr. Saito. Cobb's
          partner Arthur appears, and together they explain to Saito that new
          dream-sharing technology has rendered thoughts vulnerable to theft,
          advertising their security services to Saito as dream-sharing experts.
          After Saito leaves, Cobb steals documents from a safe upstairs, and is
          apprehended by Saito and a woman named Mal. Cobb shoots and kills
          Arthur, who wakes up in an apartment, where Cobb and Saito are
          revealed still to be asleep and dreaming. As the dream in Saito's
          mansion collapses, all of the men wake up in the apartment. Saito
          reveals that he set up the operation as an audition, and the men wake
          up again in a moving train.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Later, in Kyoto, Saito then asks Cobb whether he can perform
          "inception." Saito tells Cobb that if he can plant an idea in the mind
          of his business rival, Robert Fischer, he can reunite Cobb with his
          children in the United States. Against Arthur's judgment, Cobb
          consents to the plan and travels to Paris to find a dream "architect."
          Cobb's father-in-law Stephen Miles introduces him to Ariadne, a
          graduate student skilled in creating labyrinths.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Cobb introduces Ariadne to the basic rules and terms of dream-sharing
          technology, such as a "totem" (an object that lets a person know they
          are not dreaming) and a "kick" (a physical jolt that brings a dreamer
          out of a dream). Although Cobb's first rule is never to use memories
          to build dreams, the memory of his dead ex-wife Mal violently invades
          his shared dream with Ariadne. Cobb then travels to Mombasa to recruit
          Eames, a British forger, and Yusuf, a Kenyan chemist, to aid with the
          mission. Back in Paris, the team convenes with Saito to discuss the
          plan.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Eames maintains that the incepted idea must be simple, seemingly
          self-generated, and planted over three layers of Robert's dream.
          Ariadne becomes worried when she infiltrates Cobb's dreams one night
          to learn that he still harbors feelings of guilt about his dead wife,
          Mal, whose memory keeps erupting into his dreams. Ariadne warns Cobb
          that he cannot keep Mal imprisoned in his subconscious forever. When
          Robert Fischer's father dies, the team decides to execute their plan
          on a trans-Pacific flight from Sydney to Los Angeles, on which Robert
          Fischer is scheduled to be a passenger.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          On the plane, Cobb discreetly spikes Robert's drink with a sedative,
          and the team enters into a shared dream with Robert. They manage to
          take Robert hostage but are immediately ambushed by a team of
          rifle-wielding assailants. Saito is gravely injured, and Cobb realizes
          too late that experts have helped Robert militarize his subconscious
          against unwanted extraction. To make matters worse, Yusuf's powerful
          sedative may leave whomever is killed in the dream in
          "limbo"—unconstructed dream space. Although shaken, the team decides
          to continue with the plan. Cobb extracts combination lock numbers from
          Robert, who discusses his cold relationship with his father with his
          Uncle Peter.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          In the back of Yusuf's van, the team descends into the dream's second
          layer—a hotel lobby, where Eames poses as a female thief to distract
          Robert. Cobb, himself posing as a security expert, pretends to help
          Robert by alerting him to the robbery and leading him to a hotel room
          upstairs. Cobb manipulates Robert into becoming suspicious of the
          motives of his Uncle Peter, and the three of them sink into a third
          layer of the dream, which takes place in and around a snow-blanketed
          fortress.
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          The team scurries to complete the inception mission when they hear
          Yusuf, whose van has crashed off a bridge, give the "kick"—Edith
          Piaf's "Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien." Realizing they have limited time,
          Ariadne tells the rest of the team the quickest way to infiltrate the
          fortress. Arthur scrambles in the dream's second layer to improvise an
          effective "kick" in the hotel where Cobb and the others are asleep,
          which has become a zero-gravity environment given the falling van in
          the dream's first layer. In the third layer, Robert reaches the
          fortress's "strong room" but is shot dead by Mal, who suddenly
          appears. Cobb thinks the operation is over, but Ariadne convinces him
          to go one layer deeper in order to save Robert and redeem the mission.
          Saito dies as Eames places explosive charges around the fortress to
          act as the third layer's "kick."
          <!--br tag to provide a line break-->
          <br /><br />
          Cobb and Ariadne descend into a fourth layer of the dream: a crumbling
          cityscape that Cobb and Mal built together in the fifty years they
          spent in "limbo." Cobb confesses to Ariadne that he "incepted" the
          idea in Mal that limbo was not real, so that she would agree to wake
          up and be with their children; however, Mal continued to believe that
          reality was a dream, and eventually committed suicide, leaving Cobb
          ridden with guilt. In a nearby building, Ariadne and Cobb find Mal and
          Robert, whom Ariadne wakes up so that he can infiltrate the fortress's
          "strong room." Cobb tells Mal that she is not real, and Robert inputs
          a code in the strong room that reveals a large operating room with his
          dying father inside. Robert's father tells him to live his own life,
          rendering the inception complete. As the dreamworld collapses, Cobb
          tells Ariadne to ride the "kicks" up through the layers of the dream
          while he rescues Saito. Cobb washes up on a shore and is dragged into
          Saito's house, just like in the film's opening scene. Saito, now old,
          recognizes Cobb as a man from a half-remembered dream, and the two of
          them suddenly wake up on the passenger airliner next to Ariadne,
          Robert, Eames, and Saito, who have all successfully made it back to
          reality. Cobb arrives in the United States and is greeted by Stephen
          Miles, who takes him to his children. Cobb arrives home and goes
          outside to play with his children, while his totem continues to spin.
